bellackn.hass_control
===============

Use this role to easily set and retrieve configurations for Home Assistant. 

How to Use
----------

The role checks for configuration files on your local machine, uploads them to Home Assistant and restarts it when 
changes occurred. It can also just download the current configuration from your instance and update your local codebase
if you have made some changes manually in the Home Assistant UI.

> ðŸ’¡ It works with the Terminal & SSH plugin since the role will install Python3 in the container.

It's pretty lightweight and doesn't depend on any specific role or library.

The URL on which your Home Assistant instance is listening.

This controls whether you download the current configuration files from your Home Assistant instance, or if you want to
